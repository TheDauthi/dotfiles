# TheDauthi's dotfiles

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDauthi/dotfiles.git ~/.shellrc/dotfiles
bash ~/.shellrc/dotfiles/install
```

My dotfiles should work on OSX and linux.  They're based on a fairly bare-bones Ubuntu setup, as that's what I spend most of my time inside.  On OSX, I use [brew](http://brew.sh), and as much of the GNU userland as possible.  I use Bash 4, Bash Completion 2, and GNU find.  These will be installed if you are on OSX.

On OSX, install [brew](http://brew.sh) first.

I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage my dotfiles, installing the repository itself into `.shellrc/dotfiles`.  I then symlink the directories into the .shellrc directory, which is what is actually included into PATH, and can even be loaded by other users.  The `.shellrc` may also have a `local.d` directory, which has machine-specific settings.

### Structure
The top-level directory in my home that contains my dotfiles is called `.shellrc`.  This directory contains the git repository itself and all of the necessary directories.  There can also be a local.d directory for machine-specific dotfiles.  Other directories are created as symlinks or copies as needed.

My `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` are **not**  symlinks, which is the only unusual part of my dotbot setup.

### Rationale
For years, I've hesitated committing dotfiles to source control.  "I don't have a lot in there," I said.  "I don't want to have to set it up on every machine I work on," I said.  I don't have a fancy `.vimrc`, or use zsh.

But then....

Docker.

See, I kinda like Docker.  I think it has a few problems, but generally, I like the idea of containers.  But there are a few subcommands that aren't built in to Docker that really should be.  For example, some way of nuking a large number of images or containers at once, or removing all stopped containers.  Sure, I can do it easily, but it never works *quite* as I remember it.  So I created aliases for it.  The aliases themselves are long - I'll generally get so far as typing docker before I remember that I don't remember the `docker rmi` syntax - but they're meant to ensure I get the syntax right, not to save typing.

So, then I started looking around on every machine I touched...
